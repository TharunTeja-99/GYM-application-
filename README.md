# Gym Application — Multi-Environment CI/CD Deployment

## 1. Project Overview

The **Gym Application** is a Java-based web application packaged as a WAR file and deployed to Apache Tomcat. This project demonstrates an automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process using GitHub Actions, Maven, Git, Apache Tomcat, and AWS EC2.

The application is deployed independently to four environments:

- **DEV** — Development and initial validation
- **TEST** — Functional and integration testing
- **PRE-PROD** — Final validation before production
- **PROD** — Live production environment

Each environment has its own deployment target and configuration. When code is pushed to a configured branch, the corresponding GitHub Actions workflow builds the application and deploys the WAR file to that environment.

> **Project-specific details:** The project has been discussed with Maven WAR packaging, the artifact name `Gym-application.war`, Tomcat 9, and the context path `/Gym-application`. Confirm the paths, branch names, and server details in your actual setup before using deployment commands.

                          Tomcat
```

The diagram represents logical separation. Your actual infrastructure may use separate EC2 instances, separate Tomcat services, or another environment-isolation design.

## 5. Multi-Environment Deployment Strategy

The application is deployed independently to four environments.

| Environment | Purpose |
|---|---|
| DEV | Development and initial validation |
| TEST | Functional testing and integration testing |
| PRE-PROD | Production-like validation before release |
| PROD | Live application deployment |

### Example branch-to-environment mapping

Use the branch names that exist in your repository. The following is an example mapping:

| Git branch | GitHub Environment | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Dev` | `DEV` | Development and initial validation |
| `Test` | `TEST` | Application testing |
| `Pre-Prod` | `PRE-PROD` | Final pre-production validation |
| `main` | `PROD` | Production deployment |

Branch names are case-sensitive. If your repository uses names such as `Develop`, `stagging`, or `pre-prod`, update the workflow triggers to match them exactly.

### Example deployment flow

```text
Dev branch       --> DEV
Test branch      --> TEST
Pre-Prod branch  --> PRE-PROD
main branch      --> PROD
```

Promote changes through the environments only after the required validation is completed. Protect the production branch and use GitHub Environment approval rules for production releases.

## 6. Repository Structure

A typical Maven web application repository may use a structure similar to this:

```text
Gym-application/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── dev.yml
│       ├── test.yml
│       ├── pre-prod.yml
│       └── prod.yml
├── src/
│   └── main/
│       ├── java/
│       ├── resources/
│       └── webapp/
│           ├── WEB-INF/
│           │   └── web.xml
│           └── index.jsp
├── pom.xml
└── README.md
```

The exact source folders depend on the application's implementation. The `.github/workflows/` folder contains the workflow definitions, and `target/` is generated by Maven during a build.

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline Explanation

### Stage 1: Source Code Management

Developers maintain the Gym Application source code in GitHub. Git is used to track changes and manage branches.

### Stage 2: Workflow Trigger

A push to a configured branch triggers the matching workflow. A workflow may also support manual execution using `workflow_dispatch`.

### Stage 3: Checkout Source Code

GitHub Actions checks out the repository:

```yaml
- name: Checkout Source Code
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### Stage 4: Set up Java

The workflow configures Java 17 and Maven dependency caching:

```yaml
- name: Set up Java 17
  uses: actions/setup-java@v4
  with:
    distribution: temurin
    java-version: '17'
    cache: maven
```

If the Maven `pom.xml` is in a subdirectory, configure `cache-dependency-path` to point to that file.

### Stage 5: Maven Build

Maven builds and verifies the project:

```bash
mvn -B clean verify
```

This command removes previous build output and runs the Maven lifecycle through verification. It creates the WAR file when the project is configured for WAR packaging.

### Stage 6: WAR File Verification

Verify that the expected artifact was generated:

```bash
ls -lh target/
test -f target/Gym-application.war
```

Expected artifact:

```text
target/Gym-application.war
```

### Stage 7: Deployment

The WAR file is deployed to the Tomcat server for the selected environment. Deployment may use the Tomcat Manager Text API or an SSH/SCP-based deployment process, depending on the configured workflow.

For a Tomcat Manager deployment, the deployment account requires the `manager-script` role, and the Manager application may restrict requests by source IP. A `403` response means the request is not authorized; check the account roles and Manager access restrictions.

### Stage 8: Deployment Verification

Verify the deployed application using the environment-specific URL:

```text
http://<ENVIRONMENT_TOMCAT_HOST>:8080/Gym-application/
```

Replace the placeholder with the actual host for DEV, TEST, PRE-PROD, or PROD.

## 8. Maven Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mvn clean` | Removes previous build output |
| `mvn compile` | Compiles Java source code |
| `mvn test` | Runs configured tests |
| `mvn package` | Packages the application |
| `mvn verify` | Runs verification lifecycle checks |
| `mvn -B clean verify` | Performs a clean build and verification in batch mode |

### Maven artifact configuration

The project should be configured for WAR packaging and the expected final name in `pom.xml`:

```xml
<packaging>war</packaging>

<build>
    <finalName>Gym-application</finalName>
</build>
```

This produces:

```text
target/Gym-application.war
```

## 9. GitHub Actions Workflows

A separate workflow can be maintained for each environment.

| Workflow file | Trigger branch | GitHub Environment |
|---|---|---|
| `dev.yml` | `Dev` | `DEV` |
| `test.yml` | `Test` | `TEST` |
| `pre-prod.yml` | `Pre-Prod` | `PRE-PROD` |
| `prod.yml` | `main` | `PROD` |

Each workflow typically performs the following tasks:

1. Check out the source code.
2. Set up Java.
3. Build the project using Maven.
4. Verify the generated WAR.
5. Deploy to the corresponding Tomcat server.
6. Perform a deployment check.
7. Report the workflow result.

The branch names in this table are examples. Ensure the workflow's `on.push.branches` values match your actual branch names.

## 10. GitHub Environment Configuration

Create the four environments in:

**GitHub Repository → Settings → Environments**

Create:

- `DEV`
- `TEST`
- `PRE-PROD`
- `PROD`

Configure environment-specific secrets separately. For example, if using Tomcat Manager:

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `TOMCAT_HOST` | URL of the environment's Tomcat server |
| `TOMCAT_USER` | Tomcat deployment username |
| `TOMCAT_PASSWORD` | Tomcat deployment password |

If deploying through SSH/SCP, use the secrets required by that workflow, such as:

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `EC2_HOST` | Environment-specific EC2 host or IP |
| `EC2_USER` | SSH login user |
| `EC2_SSH_KEY` | Private SSH key used by the workflow |

Use only the secrets needed by your selected deployment method. Do not hardcode credentials in workflow files.

### Production approvals

The `PROD` GitHub Environment can be configured with required reviewers and deployment protection rules. This allows a production deployment to wait for approval before proceeding.

## 11. Tomcat Configuration

Apache Tomcat 9 hosts the Gym Application.

The application context path is:

```text
/Gym-application
```

The deployment artifact is:

```text
Gym-application.war
```

For a Tomcat Manager Text API deployment, the configured deployment user needs the `manager-script` role. Example role/user configuration syntax:

```xml
<role rolename="manager-script"/>
<user username="deploy"
      password="CHANGE_THIS_PASSWORD"
      roles="manager-script"/>
```

This is an example only. Configure credentials securely and restrict access to the Tomcat Manager application to trusted networks. Avoid exposing the Manager API to the public internet.

## 12. AWS EC2 Deployment

For each environment, ensure the relevant EC2 instance or Tomcat service is configured and reachable by the deployment workflow.

### Deployment checklist

1. Provision or identify the EC2 instance for the environment.
2. Install the required Java runtime.
3. Install and configure Apache Tomcat 9.
4. Confirm the Tomcat service is running.
5. Configure the environment's deployment credentials.
6. Configure network access only for required sources and ports.
7. Deploy the WAR file.
8. Verify the application URL and Tomcat logs.

### Useful server checks

Check whether Tomcat is listening on port 8080:

```bash
sudo ss -lntp | grep 8080
```

Check the Tomcat process:

```bash
ps -ef | grep '[t]omcat'
```

Test the application locally on the server:

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080/Gym-application/
```

Review Tomcat logs. In the previously discussed setup, Tomcat was installed at `/root/tomcat`:

```bash
tail -n 100 /root/tomcat/logs/catalina.out
```

If your environment uses another Tomcat path or a `systemd` service, update these commands accordingly.

## 13. Application URLs

Use the hostnames or IP addresses configured for each environment:

| Environment | Application URL |
|---|---|
| DEV | `http://<DEV_HOST>:8080/Gym-application/` |
| TEST | `http://<TEST_HOST>:8080/Gym-application/` |
| PRE-PROD | `http://<PREPROD_HOST>:8080/Gym-application/` |
| PROD | `http://<PROD_HOST>:8080/Gym-application/` |

Replace the placeholders with the actual environment addresses. For production, use the HTTPS URL provided by your production ingress, reverse proxy, or load balancer when configured.

## 14. Git Commands

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <YOUR_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY>
```

### View branches

```bash
git branch
git branch -r
git branch -a
```

### Switch branches

```bash
git switch Dev
git switch Test
git switch Pre-Prod
git switch main
```

Use the exact branch names present in your repository.

### Add and commit changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update Gym Application"
```

### Push changes

```bash
git push origin Dev
```

Push to the branch associated with the intended environment. For example, pushing to the configured DEV branch should trigger the DEV workflow.

### View commit history

```bash
git log --oneline
```

## 15. Troubleshooting

### Tomcat returns 404

Possible causes:

- The WAR was not deployed.
- The context path is incorrect.
- The WAR filename does not match the expected artifact.
- The application failed to start.

Check the deployed files and logs:

```bash
ls -lah <TOMCAT_HOME>/webapps/
tail -n 100 <TOMCAT_HOME>/logs/catalina.out
```

Confirm that the application URL ends with `/Gym-application/`.

### Tomcat Manager returns 403

Possible causes:

- The deployment user lacks the `manager-script` role.
- The Manager application blocks the runner's IP address.
- Remote access is restricted by Tomcat Manager configuration.

Check the Manager user roles and access restrictions. Do not solve this by opening Manager access to everyone.

### Maven build fails

Run the build locally:

```bash
mvn -B clean verify
```

Review the first relevant Maven error and check the JDK version, dependencies, and `pom.xml` configuration.

### WAR file is missing

Confirm the project uses WAR packaging and the expected final name. Then rebuild:

```bash
mvn clean verify
ls -lh target/
```

### Workflow does not trigger

Check that:

- The workflow is saved under `.github/workflows/`.
- The branch name in the trigger matches the actual branch exactly.
- GitHub Actions is enabled.
- The push reached the expected repository and branch.
- The YAML indentation is valid.

### Application fails to start

Review Tomcat logs for deployment or XML configuration errors:

```bash
tail -n 150 <TOMCAT_HOME>/logs/catalina.out
```

If the application uses `WEB-INF/web.xml`, confirm that it is valid XML and compatible with Tomcat 9.

## 16. Security Notes

- Store deployment credentials in GitHub Secrets or environment secrets.
- Never commit private SSH keys, passwords, or tokens.
- Apply least-privilege access to EC2 and AWS resources.
- Restrict SSH access to trusted sources.
- Restrict Tomcat Manager access to trusted networks.
- Avoid exposing Tomcat's port directly to the internet for production use.
- Use HTTPS for production traffic.
- Configure production approval rules.
- Maintain deployment logs and a rollback plan.
- Do not grant broad `sudo` permissions to a deployment account unless required and carefully restricted.

## 17. Future Enhancements

Possible improvements include:

- Automated unit and integration tests.
- Code quality analysis with SonarQube.
- Dependency and security scanning.
- Artifact management using Nexus or JFrog.
- Deployment health checks.
- Versioned artifact storage and rollback.
- Monitoring and centralized logging.
- HTTPS through a reverse proxy or AWS load balancer.
- Containerization using Docker.
- Kubernetes-based deployment, if required by project scope.
